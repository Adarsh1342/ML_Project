# ML_Project
Deplying Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the occurance of stroke in a person.

# About the dataset
The dataset we use consists of 5111 rows and 12 columns. <br> 
● Id : Unique Identifier. <br> 
● Gender : "Male", "Female" or "Other".<br> 
● Age : Age of the patient.<br> 
● Hypertension : 1 if the patient has hypertension or 0 if not.<br> 
● Heart_disease : 1 if the patient has a heart disease or 0 if not.<br>  ● Ever_married : "No" or "Yes". <br> 
● Work_type : "Never_worked", "Children", "Govt_job", "Private", “Self_emp".<br> 
● Residence_type : "Rural" or "Urban". <br> 
● Avg_glucose_level : Average glucose level in blood. <br> 
● Bmi : body mass index. <br> 
● Smoking_status : "Formerly smoked", "Never smoked", "Smokes" or "Unknown". <br> 
● Stroke : 1 if the patient will have a stroke or 0 if not.

# SETUP
1.Download the repository usiing the "git clone" command.<br> 
2.Upload the "stroke_prediction.ipynb" file to google colab.<br> 
3.Upload the "healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv" file to the runtime.<br>
4.Copy and Paste the relative path of the dataset to """ stroke_data=pd.read_csv(**'/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv'**) """ <br>
5.Run the colab file.
